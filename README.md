1.	bank search screen which would show a list of banks
2.	user should be able to search by text for the banks, across all the fields (important: there would be no search button)
3.	pagination for the results of the search, the user should be able to select page size
4.	mark some banks as favourites. View banks that were marked as favourites (favourites should persist state event if the website is refreshed or reloaded)
